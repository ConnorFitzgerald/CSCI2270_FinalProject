# Data-Structures-Final-Project

Project Summary:
We are going to attempt to program a choose your own adventure game. It will combine all the major fandoms: Star Wars, Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter. The user will be able to travel to the different fandom realms and make decisions to finish the quest and increase their strength. They'll be able to earn certain items to help them defeat the final boss. The user will traverse through a graph with each node containing a step in the adventure.  There will be a Charater class to customize the character as well as the functions that will make the journey possible.
